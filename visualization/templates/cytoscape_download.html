                <p>The 181 robust lincRNAs (red nodes; lincRNAs from the main intersection in the UpSet Intersection
Diagram on Fig. 4 from the Sci. Rep. paper) were used as bait for catching 2,359 PC genes (blue nodes) whose expression levels across five
developmental stages are either positively (r ≥ 0.8, cyan edges) or negatively (r ≤ −0.8, gray edges) correlated
with the expression levels of the lincRNAs. The network contains 68,625 edges among which 63,156 (92%)
are positive correlations and 5,469 (8%) negative ones.</p>
<p>This network is called "pccAll-cor0p8sigpval2net-DEedgeDE-lincSMP-181mainInt.sif" within the cytoscape file "CoexpNetwork-cor0p8-DEedgeDE-lincSMP-181mainInt.cys", which can be downloaded through the green button below.</p>
<p><b>Complete view of the lincRNA-PC gene co-expression network built by the Topological Filtering Step (TFS) approach. </b></p>
<p>“Network Analyzer” function from cytoscape was used in order to obtain betweenness centrality
score for each node, meaning the bigger the node, the higher propensity to be a hub. The network
contains 89 SmLINC nodes (red) and 237 PC gene (Smp) nodes (blue), with 62.5% of positively
correlated pairs (204 / 326, r ≥ 0.5, cyan edges) and 37.5% of negatively correlated ones (122 /
326, r ≤ -0.5, gray edges). Dashed edges represent neighbor genes.</p>

rescue all the other genes that presented a very stringent expression correlation coefficient (r ≥
0.9 or r ≤ -0.9) with them.</p>
